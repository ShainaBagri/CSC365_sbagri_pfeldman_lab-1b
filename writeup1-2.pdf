Team Members: Piper Feldman and Shaina Bagri

We used Python to develop since Shaina has experience using the pandas package in Python from her data science class.
Piper had experience using the Visual Studio Code Liveshare, so we developed in a VS Code environment. We also used GitHub
and git to facilitate collaboration on the code development. We essentially kept the same initial decisions from Part A.
We decided to split up each command into a separate function to make the code more readable and easier to debug. We primarily
used the dataframe structure that comes with the pandas package. This structure allowed us to easily parse the csv file into a 
database structure. We continued with the same internal architecture from Part A.

Final notes:
While commands are case sensitive, user inputs such as last names are not. While parsing the user input, we convert the student or
teacher names given to be entirely uppercase. The formats of the commands that can be invoked are listed in the README.
